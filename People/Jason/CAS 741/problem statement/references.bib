               This chapter focuses on simply supported beams. A beam is said to be in equilibrium when there is no tendency for it to move. There are two conditions for equilibrium, namely, the sum of the forces acting vertically downward must be equal to the sum of the forces acting vertically upward and the total moment of the forces acting on a beam must be zero. A simply supported beam is one that rests on two supports and is free to move horizontally. Typical practical applications of simply supported beams with point loadings include bridges, beams in buildings, and beds of machine tools. Although for equilibrium, the forces and moments cancel the magnitude and nature of these forces, and the moments are important as they determine both stresses and the beam curvature and deflection. Furthermore, the values of shearing force and bending moment will usually vary along a beam.}

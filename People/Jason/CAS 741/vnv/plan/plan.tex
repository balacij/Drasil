% GENERAL INFORMATION

\section{General Information}

This document describes the plan of action related to the Verification and
Validation (VnV) of the Beam Bending analysis program (\progname{}). This VnV
plan will describe a plan of action for \textit{validating} that the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS)~\cite{BalaciBeamBendingSRS2023} for \progname{}
satisfies stakeholders, and \textit{verifying} that a supposedly conforming
software does indeed accurately satisfy the requirements.

\subsection{Summary}

The BeamBending Software Requirements Specification
(SRS)~\cite{BalaciBeamBendingSRS2023} describes the requirements of a
hypothetical program that analyzes beam deflection under imposed, distributed
loads on a simply-supported beam.

\subsection{Objectives}

The objective of this document is to outline a plan of action for:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textit{auditing} a continuously developed SRS document
          \cite{ParnasAndClements1986} for logical consistency,

    \item \textit{validating} said SRS satisfies stakeholder requirements, and

    \item \textit{verifying} that a produced software artifact conforms
          everything laid out in the SRS document (including, but not limited
          to, the functional and nonfunctional requirements), through both
          transparent and opaque testing.

\end{enumerate}

In doing this, we hope to build confidence in the coherence of software
requirements, and correctness and conformance of a software to said
specifications.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

As we intend to build (generate) the software with Drasil, the only relevant
documentation is that which is originally manually built, including:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item the SRS document \cite{BalaciBeamBendingSRS2023}, and

    \item this VnV plan.

\end{enumerate}

\noindent{}When the \progname{} program is re-created in Drasil, we may think of
that as a sort of ``documentation'' that we can to the above list.

\section{Plan}

The ``whole'' Verification and Validation plan for \progname{} consists of
multiple sub-plans. Notably, it has a designated team (with sub-teams) who will
be executing the related sub-plans stipulated in this document. Team members
will take responsibility for various aspects of verification and validation.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

Roles (\Cref{table:vnv_roles}) are assigned to each team member
(\Cref{table:vnv_teammates}), dictating the minimum responsibilities each member
has for each related project.

\end{longtable}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

In addition to checking that \progname{}'s Software Requirements Specification
(SRS) conforms to Dr.\ Smith's provided SRS checklist, we will have:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item a designated reviewing committee with a supervisor,

    \item a public presentation with a reviewing audience,

    \item built the project in Drasil, where we can build automated consistency
          checks and generate certain aspects of the document to avoid error,

    \item at least one external reviewer (Dr.\ Jacques Carette of the Drasil
          project) when the whole \progname{} project is sent to the main Drasil
          repository for merging, and finally,

    \item regular updates and sporadic reviews by current and future Drasil team
          members and onlookers (assuming the project is merged as an official
          case study of Drasil).

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

The software design does not need verification as the design of the software
will be based on Drasil's existing software family generator~\cite{Drasil2023}.
However, in order to build the Boundary Value Problem (BVP) in Drasil, we will
need to extend Drasil to generate BVP solving methods\footnote{This will be done
    and assumed as ``trusted'' when accepted into Drasil's main
    codebase~\cite{Drasil2023}.}. The onus of Drasil's validation is up to the
Drasil team\footnote{Including, but not limited to, Dr.\ Spencer Smith, Sam
    Crawford, and Jason Balaci.}.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

To assure that the Verification and Validation Plan adequately tests both the
SRS document and the relevant software, we will largely assume the ``many eyes''
hypothesis~\cite{Caraco1980avian} with many ``eyes'' of different skill-sets and
academic backgrounds (see \Cref{table:vnv_teammates}). Each team member should
test that this document conforms to the general VnV Checklist
document~\cite{SmithCapTemplate}.

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

A proof of concept should be built and manually tested. When the project is
re-created in Drasil, the generated software artifacts should be similar to the
proof of concept, up to code style and organization. The generated software
artifacts should be tested against the manually created artifacts if non-trivial
or significant differences exist. Additionally, as Drasil does not yet generate
unit tests\footnote{But Sam might fix this for us!}, the unit tests will be
ported over to the generated software artifacts.

By re-writing the SRS with Drasil, the software implementation will be
generated. We have faith in the Drasil work, and so, the ``Implementation
Verification Plan'' is largely a ``Solution Validation Plan'' with an extra set
of requirements for the configuration of Drasil's code generator. The solution
proposed in the SRS is to be validated by peer review, code walkthrough,
external audit, audit by assigned reviewers (see \Cref{table:vnv_roles}), and
audit by the supervisor (Dr.\ Smith). The configuration requirements for
Drasil's code generator are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item generate code:

          \begin{enumerate}

              \item in Python,

              \item with full code comment coverage\footnote{The ratio of the
                        number of well-documented ``code'' components to the
                        number of ``code'' components, where a code component is
                        defined as any logical component of a codebase (such as
                        functions, data types, classes, etc.).}, and

              \item ``full'' modularity\footnote{The generated software artifact
                        should be broken up into multiple logically grouped
                        software artifacts.},

          \end{enumerate}

    \item generate a Makefile with all common usage types (e.g., build, run,
          deps) as targets,

    \item generate basic usage documentation, and

    \item generate SRS artifacts from the same pool of knowledge used to build
          the previous two components.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

The reference code implementation and final generated code artifacts will be
tested (along with code coverage) using \textbf{pytest}~\cite{PyTest} to
automatically test the code against a series of unit tests (see
\Cref{sec:unit_test_description}). Continuous integration will be used to assure
that changes to the SRS encoding in Drasil does not change against the
well-tested artifacts\footnote{These are captured in the ``stable'' folder in
    Drasil's code repository, where ``stable'' artifacts remain manually tested.}.
The Python code will be aggressively formatted with Black~\cite{PythonBlack}.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

As the problem described in the SRS is similar to beam deflection problems
commonly found in engineering textbooks (such as \cite{BeerJohnston1981}), we
will assume a potential stakeholder is a writer of one of said textbooks.
Dr.~Spencer Smith will also be an assumed stakeholder in the project as he
suggested this project to the author. Input, output, and theory-based inspection
will primarily be done to ensure that that information contained in the SRS and
the software satisfies stakeholders.

\newpage{}

\section{System Test Description}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

The tests for functional requirements may be split up into 3 categories, as
follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item testing that inputs match the understood inputs
          (R2~\cite{BalaciBeamBendingSRS2023}),

    \item testing that the BVP solver functions as expected, and
    
    \item testing that the whole program accurately follows the instance models
          as described in the SRS (R3~\cite{BalaciBeamBendingSRS2023}).
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Testing Inputs Are Outputted Accurately}

Throughout the next two categories of testing the functional requirements, we
will have tests on the program, and each test should be additionally
automatically checked that the re-iterated outputs match the intended inputs.

\subsubsection{Testing BVP Solver}

All of the tests for testing the BVP solver (\Cref{tab:simple_automatic_tests})
are done \textit{automatically} with a trivially ``empty'' initial state (e.g.,
the program is not started and has been provided no inputs yet), and trivial
inputs other than the BVPs themselves. The focus of this section is to test the
BVP solver. The inputs should be provided as appropriate and the expected output
should be printed. Each test will observe \(\forall x : \mathbb{R} ~.~x \in (0,
L_B) \Rightarrow (y(x) \approx_{\epsilon} y_a(x))\) (with pytest using samples
or symbolic equivalence, depending on solution). The expected outputs are
confirmed using WolframAlpha~\cite{WolframAlpha}.

\subsubsection{Testing Outputs with Non-trivial Inputs}

All of the tests from \Cref{tab:simple_automatic_tests} should be performed
again\footnote{Note: referencing here will be done with the BVP subscript
removed, $T*$.} with non-trivial $E_B$s and $I_B$s (e.g., not $1$). Since
numeric scaling isn't very consequential to the output, we will omit for
brevity. WolframAlpha may be similarly used as a control.

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

The nonfunctional requirements are relatively uncomplicated to audit, mostly
because of the usage of Drasil:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item[$T_\text{NFR1}$] \textbf{Accuracy} is satisfied primarily through the
                tests of the functional requirements having a low
                tolerance\footnote{As this software is purely educational,
                accepting a higher tolerance is fine too.},

    \item[$T_\text{NFR2}$] \textbf{Usability} is strongly tied to Drasil's
                ability to generate code that can output
                data\footnote{Unfortunately, list-like functionality remains
                limited, but will be improved. Also note that ``usability'' was
                defined in the SRS document. Specifically, we will not be
                testing for accessibility nor any other facet as this software
                is meant to be an intermediate program used for calculation, not
                visualization.},

    \item[$T_\text{NFR3}$] \textbf{Maintainability} is satisfied through being
                constructed in Drasil, where changes in information have
                rippling effects and re-generation allows us to update
                everything to accomodate changes,

    \item[$T_\text{NFR4}$] \textbf{Portability} is satisfied because we aim to
                generate Python code, but also because all of Drasil's supported
                output languages are supported on the 3 major personal operating
                systems.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

The following table traces the test cases as shown in the earlier sections back
to the functional and nonfunctional requirements\footnote{Note that $*$ is used
to quantify over each individual test case as it is redundant to have identical
rows for the tests that are each intended to test the same concepts.}.

\begin{longtable}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \caption{Tracing Tests to Requirements}

\section{Unit Test Description}
\label{sec:unit_test_description}

As no software design documents will be constructed for Team Drasil's projects,
we will bootstrap the Drasil-generated software artifacts for testing. This
section will be filled in once we have Drasil generating code.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

In addition to the symbolic parameters from the SRS
document~\cite{BalaciBeamBendingSRS2023}, we will add \(\epsilon\), where
\(\epsilon = 10^{-3}\) (m), for usage as a tolerance for equivalence.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions}

As the project will rely on Drasil to build the software from the requirement
description, any and all ``usability'' and/or ``accessibility'' concerns should
be directed towards the Drasil team as \progname{} will only use their basic
(stable) public-facing tooling.
